# kirin
Kirin is a lightweight framework for multithreading and asynchronous programming. All codes are implemented using C/C++.

All operations are modeled as cpu work, disk read & write, and network transfering. Unfortunately, only some easy and basic functions have been implemented, most are still under developing using my extremely limited free time after work.
